## Introduction

_panelmap_ creates panels for summarizing binary data, categorical data (more than 2 categories) and continuous data for known groups. Groups can arise from classification algorithms such as kmeans, or other class labels as provided by the user. _panelmap_ is a visual aid to understand associations and trends in data instead from tedious tables and trying to infer multiple plots. 

Each row of  _panelmap_ is called a _panelet_ (singular). Many panelets aassemble together to make a _panelmap_ . We first begin by making a panelet for the solution. See [panelet.group]. Rest of the variables are plotted according to the nature of the data - discrete (binary/categorical) - See [panelet.category] , or continuous - See [panelet.continuous] . The function, [make.panel] , is a wrapper function of the above mentioned functions. 

We will use `mtcars` data set to illustrate the usage of panlemap. 

See below an example of `panelmap`. 

## Installation

## Requirements 

## Example - panelmap 

We will illustarate _panlemap_ by sorting mtcars data according to variable $cyl$ and plotting $mpg, vs, am$ and $gear$ to undersatnd the relationship between them. 
```{r,fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

#sort everything by cyl
mtcars.sort = mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl),]
#otehr features to plot
mat = mtcars.sort[,c("mpg","vs","am","gear")]

#color assigned to each feature
mat.col=list(am=c("white","black"), vs=c("white","black"), gear=c("yellow","orange","brown"), mpg=c("white", "darkred"))

#type of each feature. type=1 for discrete and type=2 for continuous. 
mat.type= c(2,1,1,1)
tt=make.panel(soln=mtcars.sort$cyl, soln.name="cyl",soln.col=c("red","blue","green"), mat=mat, mat.col=mat.col, mat.type=mat.type, border=TRUE, legend=TRUE)
kable(tt, caption="Association table corresponding to panelmap")
```

One can see, how all the variables align with vehicles with 4,6 and 8 cylinder engines, all at a single glance!

`vs` - Binary variable signaling the engine cylinder configuration a V-shape (vs=0) or Straight Line (vs=1). V

`am` - A binary variable signaling whether vehicle has automatic (am=0) or manual (am=1) transmission configuration.


## Example - circomap 

_circomap_ is a visulaizing tool to plot and anlyze multiple panelmaps, insipired by the circlize^{1} package. 

To illustrate the functionality of _circomap_ we will draw the above panelmap three times in a circular layout. 

```{r,fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
#dataset 1
dat1 = mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl),]
#dataset 2
dat2 = mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl),]
#dataset 3
dat3 = mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl),]

#put all the datasets in a list 
datasets<-list()
datasets[[1]]=dat1; datasets[[2]]=dat2; datasets[[3]]=dat3
names(datasets) = c("dat1", "dat2", "dat3")
#names of datasets will be used to labek the datasets

#group variable to plot same as panelet_group
gtoplot<-c("cyl")
gcol = c("red","blue","green")
gheight = 0.10 #track height of the group variable 

#features to plot - same as in panelmap example 
ftoplot<-c("mpg", "vs", "am", "gear")
ftype= c(2,1,1,1)
fcol=list(am=c("white","black"), vs=c("white","black"), gear=c("yellow","orange","brown"), mpg=c("white", "darkred"))

fheight<-list(); fheight[1:length(ftoplot)] = 0.08
#Voila!! 
circomap(datasets, gtoplot, gcol, gheight, ftoplot, ftype, fcol, fheight)


```

##Functions and Usage 

There are three core functions of `panelmap`.

### panelet.group

Given a solution, make a group panelet. Let `cyl` variable with values 4,6 and 8 be our group variable from package `mtcars`. Let's assign the colors `red`, `blue` and `green` to its values as follows :- 

```{r, echo=T, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
#adjust margins and number of panelet values 
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(0,8,0,14))

#sort the entire data frame according to the group solution you are interested in 
mtcars.sort = mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl),]

#plot group
tt=panelet.group(soln=mtcars.sort$cyl, soln.col=c("red","blue","green"),soln.name="cyl",cex=1, border=FALSE, legend=FALSE)

```

`cex` controls the magnification of text labels on the left-hand side. `border` and `legend` take logical values and their default value is `FALSE`. 

Once we have a group panelet, we can start plotting other variables of interest. 

### panelet.category

This function plots dicrete data type. Usage - `function(pp,pp.col,soln, var.n="var.n",labels.col="black",`

`NA.flag=FALSE, NA.col="grey", get.pval=FALSE, border=FALSE, cex=1, border.col="black", legend=FALSE)` 

These are the default values to the function. There is an option to assign a color for `NAs` in the data by using `NA.flag` and `NA.col`. User can also control the color of border colors by `border.col` 

```{r, echo=T,fig.width=8, fig.height=4, message=F}
#adjust margins and number of panelet values 
par(mfrow=c(6,1),mar=c(0,8,0,14))

#sort the entire data frame according to the group solution you are interested in 
mtcars.sort = mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl),]

#plot group
tt=panelet.group(soln=mtcars.sort$cyl, soln.col=c("red","blue","green"),soln.name="cyl",cex=1, border=FALSE, legend=FALSE)

#plot variable am
tt=panelet.category(pp=mtcars.sort$am, pp.col=c("white", "black"), soln=mtcars.sort$cyl, var.n="am", get.pval=TRUE)

#plot variable vs
tt=panelet.category(mtcars.sort$vs, c("white", "black"), mtcars.sort$cyl, "vs", get.pval=TRUE)

#let's assign NAs to am
am.na = mtcars.sort$am
am.na[c(1,10,20,30)] = NA
tt=panelet.category(pp=am.na, pp.col=c("white", "black"), soln=mtcars.sort$cyl, var.n="am.na", get.pval=TRUE, NA.flag=TRUE, NA.col="grey", labels.col = "red")

```

See how there are grey bars in panelet row __am.na__ corresponding to NA at values 1,10,20 and 30. 

`panelet.category` also returns the summary of the variable with respect to the group variable along with an association test. 


### panelet.continuous 

This function provides a gradient of the values present in the continuous variable. Note that this function plots a gradient and assigns colors relative to the range and magnitude of values in the variable. If the values are a mix of negative and positive values the gradient might look biased and lack in contrast. We will try to address this in a future functionality. 

```{r, echo=T,fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
#adjust margins and number of panelet values 
par(mfrow=c(6,1),mar=c(0,8,0,14))

#sort the entire data frame according to the group solution you are interested in 
mtcars.sort = mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl),]

#plot group
tt=panelet.group(soln=mtcars.sort$cyl, soln.col=c("red","blue","green"),soln.name="cyl",cex=1, border=TRUE, legend=FALSE)

#plot variable mpg
tt =panelet.continuous(mtcars.sort$mpg, pp.col=c("white","darkred"), soln=mtcars.sort$cyl,var.n="mpg", labels.col="black",NA.flag=FALSE, get.pval=TRUE, border=TRUE)
                       
```


### make.panel 

`make.panel` is a wrapper function that outputs a legend, an association table and the panelmap, all with one command. You need to provide the meta information of your data set like, colors, data type, labels color etc. See [Example]
